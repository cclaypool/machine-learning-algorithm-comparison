# machine-learning-algorithm-comparison
A C++ implementation and performance comparison of two machine learning algorithms, deep learning and decision tree learning. Created as the final project for CMP201 (Data Structures and Algorithms 1) at Abertay University. To suit the requirements of this module, the algorithms are written from scratch with no use of external libraries and are CPU-based and single-threaded.

Once compiled, the resulting executable must be run in a directory containing the CSV files under `data/`. These data files are a split version of the Banknote Authentication Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication).
